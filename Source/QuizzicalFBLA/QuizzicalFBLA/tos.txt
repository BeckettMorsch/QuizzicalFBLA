You and </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c3">&nbsp;hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim (defined below). All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;relating to or arising from these Terms, the Site, Services or any Content (each a &quot;Claim&quot;) shall be submitted for binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its rules and procedures (&quot;AAA Rules&quot;) including the AAA&#39;s Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA&#39;s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">Arbitration Procedures: The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator must be a lawyer with at least 10 years of experience or a retired judge. The arbitration hearing shall be held in New York County, New York. However, if you reside in a state other than New York, you will offer </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the opportunity to make the hearing convenient to you by permitting </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c3">&nbsp;to select to: (a) conduct the hearing solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, with the parties participating through telephonic or video conference hearings; or (b) arbitrate in your state of residence at a location reasonably convenient to you and </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c3">. In addition, in cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c1">The arbitrator&#39;s decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties, except for a limited right of review as provided in the FAA. Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">Costs. If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c1">will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator&#39;s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate. Each party shall bear the expense of that party&#39;s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, regardless of which party prevails in the arbitration, unless applicable law gives a party the right to recover any of those fees from the other party.</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">Class Action Waiver: Neither you nor </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c3">may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, and there should also be no joinder or consolidation of parties. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or </span><span class="c10">Quizzical&rsquo;s</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">If any portion of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific portion shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect; provided however, that if the Class Action Waiver is deemed invalid, then this entire Section shall be null and void. No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of these Terms. This Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your relationship with </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">Small Claims; Action by Government Agencies: This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c3">&nbsp;from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c3">&nbsp;also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and </span><span class="c10">Quizzical </span><span class="c1">&nbsp;retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with these Terms, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. THE ARBITRATOR&#39;S DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING EXCEPT FOR A LIMITED RIGHT TO REVIEW AS PROVIDED IN THE FAA. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR </span><span class="c15">Quizzical</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.</span></p>

The dispute, difference or claim will be resolved in accordance with the law of Spain.</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c1">To avoid any doubt, arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, which replaces the traditional judicial system. In arbitration who resolves the dispute is an arbitrator and not a judge, by means of an arbitral award, binding on the parties.</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c1">This procedure is more informal than a legal action before a court and offers greater advantages, such as greater speed in the resolution of the conflict and warrant the confidentiality of the dispute, since it is a private process in which the awards do not enjoy publicity, unlike judicial sentences.</span></p>
